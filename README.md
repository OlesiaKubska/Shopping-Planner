- Vite: Efficient project building and development with support for hot module replacement.
- SCSS Modules: Local styling of components using CSS Modules for style isolation.
## Features
- Adding Products: Users can add products to the list, specifying the name, category, and whether the product is a food item.

- Shopping List Management: Products can be added to a shopping list, marked as purchased, and removed from the list.
